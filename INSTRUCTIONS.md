# Context and problem

in the context of EVERSE, we have these services :
* RSQKit - knowledge base with tasks https://everse.software/RSQKit/tasks
* indicators - a catalogue of indicators defined as JSON files in https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators
* TechRadar - a catalogue of tools for software quality defined as JSON files in https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar - tools are related to indicators in their schema
* resqui - a framework to run quality pipelines using tools and indicators - https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/QualityPipelines
* dashverse - dashboards to visualize these indicators and high level metrics - https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/DashVERSE/
as you can see, all the services are connected in some way.
I am trying to elaborate a strategy to connect them in the best way. What would be your recommendations as a senior engineer ? We need something easy to use and maintain for researchers and research engineers. Free would be better.
